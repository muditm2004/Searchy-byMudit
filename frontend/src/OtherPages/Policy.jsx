        We don't collect your data. Period. Seriously, we wouldn't even know how
        to spy on you if we tried. Here's how it works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No tracking, no cookies, no logs.</li>
        <p>
          We don't peek into your search history, save your queries, or leave
          digital crumbs behind.
        </p>
        <li>No ads, no profiling.</li>
        <p>
          We're not interested in selling you stuff or building a weird digital
          version of you.
        </p>
        <li>No encryption, no problem.</li>
        <p>
          We don't save anything, so there's nothing to protect. Your searches
          are like whispers in the wind—here one moment, gone the next.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What's the catch? There isn't one. Searchy is like
        a blank slate: no drama, no data hoarding, just fast and simple
        searches.
     </p>
     <p>
        If you're into complicated legal jargon and “terms of service” pages
        longer than your grocery list… well, this isn't the place for that.
     
        Questions? Complaints? Love letters? You can yell into the void, but we
        probably won't hear you. (Kidding! You can reach out on{" "}
